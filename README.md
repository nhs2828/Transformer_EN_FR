This is my implementation of Transformer translator FR-EN based on the [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf).</br>
Dataset used is a small EN-FR [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devicharith/language-translation-englishfrench)</br>
<p>This implementation helps to understand clearly how Attention mechanism works, also to understand the performance of Transformer model in Natural Language Processing. The dataset is pretty small, a small number of traing epochs is sufficient in order to avoid over-fitting.</br>

The performance is very satisfying with 10 epochs of training, we translate well short sentences from English to French.</br>
